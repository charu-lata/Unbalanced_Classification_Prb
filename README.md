# Unbalanced data classification problem

The data.zip file contains training dataset used to train a classifier model. The target variable 'outcome' is unbalanced with 1:10 proportion. I have compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVM classifiers. To improve model AUC, I performed oversampling of the minority target variable category.
