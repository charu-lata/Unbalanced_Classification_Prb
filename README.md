# Unbalanced data classificaition problem

The data.zip file contains training dataset to train a classifier model. The target variable is 'outcome' which is unbalanced with 1:10 proportion. I have compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVM classifiers. To improve model AUC, I performed oversampling the minority target variable category.
